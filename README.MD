# Document extractor play project

This project is meant to illustrate some ideas around extracting information from LLMs using googles vertex ai api.

# Running the program

## check out code

This project is hosted on github and is available publicly

git@github.com:browndar/MedicalRecords.git

## add service credentials

I've provided service credentials for my account with vertex. I'll disable them after a some time. Copy this file to 'src/main/resources'. It must have the same name as was provided (ending in json file extension as well)

## build

./gradlew build

## run

assuming no failures, you can simply run the main class

./gradlew run
